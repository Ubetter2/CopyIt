# CopyIt

At the start I would like to say, that CopyIt is still in development. That means that some features like PC google login or live camera text scaning will hopefully implementet
in near future.

-APP function
Sometimes you have some text on your phone, but you need to transfer it to PC and work from there. That is the main app idea. You can paste, scan or share your text and if you are logged
in on your PC the text will be coppied to your clipboard making it super simple to transfer anything.

-How?
Text transfer is made throw Firebase.
